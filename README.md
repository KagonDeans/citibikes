*** Pedal Forward: Exploring Citibike Usage in NYC ***

*Project Overview*

I developed an interactive streamlit application to explore the factors that influences bike usage in NYC using citibike.

*Motivation*

I chose this topic due to my interest in transportation and the unique nature of bike riding, which can be both a necessity and a leisure activity. I aimed to understand the conditions under which most bike rides occur.

*Challenges and Approach*

I worked with Citibike data spanning the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, totaling over 60 million records. Handling this large dataset was challenging due to computational constraints. To manage this, I processed each year's data separately and condensed it to daily records. Another challenge was balancing the need to explore interesting data while staying focused on the project's goals.
*Data Source and Tools*

Citibike data: [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) with a total of 67,720,005 records used throughout the project.

Weather data: [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/daily-summaries?bbox=40.963,-74.257,40.463,-73.757&startDate=2019-01-01T00:00:00&endDate=2022-12-31T23:59:59), Collected from the NYC Central Park weather station. Originally containing 59 variables, I used 9 relevant variables after filtering out missing and irrelevant data. 

The tools used are:

• Python for data handling and analysis.
• Streamlit for building the interactive dashboard.

*Usage*

My dashboard consists of 3 pages, each offering unique functionalities:
